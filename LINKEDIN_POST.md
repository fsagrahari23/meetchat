ðŸš€ Just Completed an Exciting Full-Stack Project: Omegle Clone - Real-time Video Chat Application! ðŸŽ¥

I'm thrilled to share my latest project - a real-time video chat application built with cutting-edge web technologies! This Omegle-style app allows users to connect with others for peer-to-peer video calling and instant messaging.

ðŸ”§ **Key Technologies Used:**
â€¢ Frontend: React 19, Tailwind CSS, WebRTC, Socket.IO Client
â€¢ Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO
â€¢ Real-time Communication: WebRTC for P2P video streaming
â€¢ State Management: React Context API

ðŸŒŸ **Core Features:**
âœ“ Real-time video calling with WebRTC
âœ“ Instant messaging between connected users
âœ“ Room-based connection system
âœ“ Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
âœ“ Cross-platform compatibility

âš¡ **How It Works:**
The application uses WebRTC for peer-to-peer video streaming, eliminating the need for intermediary servers for media transmission. Socket.IO handles signaling and real-time messaging between users. When users join the same room, they can connect directly for video calls and chat.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in:
- Full-stack web development
- Real-time communication protocols
- Modern JavaScript frameworks
- WebRTC implementation
- Responsive UI design
